# ðŸ’³ Fraud Detection System for Financial Transactions

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project focuses on building a robust, real-time Fraud Detection System for financial transactions using the PaySim simulated dataset. The system uses machine learning classification models and a Streamlit-based dashboard to predict potentially fraudulent activities.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Financial institutions face increasing challenges in identifying fraudulent transactions. This project aims to:

âœ” Detect fraudulent transactions using historical data  
âœ” Build a machine learning model with optimized performance  
âœ” Deploy a real-time prediction interface using Streamlit

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset Description

The project uses the *PaySim Simulated Financial Transactions Dataset*, which contains:

| Column Name         | Description                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| step              | Time step of the transaction              |
| type              | Type of transaction (TRANSFER, CASH_OUT, etc.) |
| amount            | Transaction amount                        |
| oldbalanceOrg     | Sender's balance before transaction       |
| newbalanceOrig    | Sender's balance after transaction        |
| oldbalanceDest    | Receiver's balance before transaction     |
| newbalanceDest    | Receiver's balance after transaction      |
| isFraud           | Target variable (1 = Fraud, 0 = Genuine)  |
